# Dancing System - Group 5

## This repository is used for implementing the system that we designed in the design report. 

## Communication Perspective 

## Hardware Perspective 

## Software Perspective
Basically, there are four algorithms that we trained during the journey of this project. We choose two different implementions of MLP from Dingfan and Archana to form our final Machine Learning subsystem. 

- Random Forest 
- KNN
- MLP
- CNN

## Knowledgement
I would like to thank the whole teamâ€™s hard work to make the whole system communicate smoothly and predict precisely.
